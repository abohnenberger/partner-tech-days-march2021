Automated Smart Management Workshop: Configuring and performing an OpenSCAP Scan
================================================================================

In this part of the workshop, we will learn how to configure and perform an OpenSCAP scan using playbooks in Ansible Automation Platform with Satellite. When running multiple Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems, it's important to keep all of these systems compliant with a meaningful security policy and perform security scans remotely from a single location. OpenSCAP is an open source project that is used by government agencies, corporations, as well as e-commerce. OpenSCAP provides tools for automated vulnerability checking. Satellite is has RPM packages for SCAP workbench v1.2.0-5 which provides our scanning capabilities and is also loaded with the SCAP security guide v0.1.54-3 for RHEL7 and CentOS devices which provides the appropriate XCCDF benchmarks for PCI and STIG complianc (among several others).

#### 2\. Creating a new compliance policy

Now we will start configuring a compliance policy to be able to scan our RHEL nodes.

-   In Satellite hover over 'Hosts' from the menu on the left side pane, and then click on 'Policies'

-   Click on the "New Policy" button, and fill out the details as followed in step 3.

#### 3\. Configuring a new compliance policy

Now we will start configuring our Satellite server to be able to manage a compliance policy

-   Select "Manual" from the deployment options and click "Next"

#### 4\. Logging into the Ansible Automation Platform

-   Use a web browser on your computer to access the Ansible GUI via the link found in the Environment above

![login screen](images/1-compliance-aap2-login.png)

Once you're in Ansible Automation Platform, you'll be able to see a dashboard.

#### 5\. Configure and launch an Ansible Automation Platform template to run an OpenSCAP scan. 

This step will allow us to scan a single rhel7 host with the ```PCI_Compliance``` policy that we configured on Satellite.

-   In Ansible Automation Platform click 'Templates' from the left side pane menu

-   Click the GREEN + icon on the far right side of the screen to activate the drop-down selection menu, then click "Job Template". Fill out the details as follows. 

        Name: OpenSCAP_Configure

        Job Type: Run

        Inventory: RHEL7 Development

        Project: Automated Management 

        Playbook: configure_openscap.yml

        Credentials: Satellite Credential, Workshop Credential (Click the magnifying glass icon to select. Select Satellite_Collection in the CREDENTIAL TYPE    
                     dropdown to add the Satellite Credential)

        Extra Variables (Keep the exact spacing provided below. Note that the extra-vars that we are supplying need to be in YAML format):

        HOSTS: node1.example.com
        Policy_scan: 
          - PCI_Compliance

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/X-K7LAtX-1GT5b6-rNeqjFLTH2M4HIZs5LLBPpX8A2Njv84nc98DuvW5jRu6nxcvJmW5Uh5m737o0XEELvysycCIWeloS90MiYB-sIHqmxbv1DSCkQi6-kRq0gmLrP_ZDPIabZiT)

-   Leave the rest of the fields blank or as they are, and click 'Save'. You can then select 'Launch' to deploy the job template.

#### 6\. Navigate back to Satellite to examine the Asset Reporting File (ARF). 

-   Hover over 'Hosts' from the side pane menu and then click on 'Reports'.

-   Click on the [Full Report] button for 'node1.example.com' to evaluate

-   Scroll down to the **Rule Overview** section. You can sort by "Pass", "Fail", "Fixed", or any number of qualifiers as well as group rules by "Severity"

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hu_26q9h1QEMEAs6_57yiqDngir1xM5lolQWOSsDkOOzuiCpSUKtYDDk3TLc2zMozmLNWcmmDXMVuIulAvsolKZa_t6Siu62mqLabFdgO19Mr-V6rw6E14n7qYUxmmwt2PpaiapP)

-   Selecting a rule presents further information regarding rationale as well as a description of the rule that includes references and identifiers.
-   Now, uncheck everything except the **fail** checkbox. Then scroll down and click on the failure "Prevent Login to Accounts With Empty Password"

-   If you scroll the page you will notice multiple remediation options including an 'Ansible' snippet. Click "(show)" next to the 'Remediation Ansible snippet', which then presents tasks you can include within a playbook to automate remediation across affected systems.

#### 7\. Expanding OpenSCAP policy scans

This step will expand our OpenSCAP policy scan to add another XCCDF compliance profile called ```STIG_Compliance```. We will also expand to include all systems in the 'RHEL7 Development' inventory by adjusting the 'HOSTS' extra variable to 'all' instead of specifying a single system.

-   In Satellite, hover over "Hosts" from the menu on the left side of the screen, and then click on "Policies".

-   Click on the "New Compliance Policy" button 

-   Select "Manual" from the deployment options and click "Next"

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/j9IPZGS-LJPKAZJj4k6wZbbx15cAkOtvqT_UBDj2iAzhi5_Mkkq6aGZClS8gSq__DxVEMsPik-pQVDEK7l2JqWJNYZJXGr2yNdETyeNaSydhU8A205f9cha97QQYNLzlPRjW9-Ka)

-   Create the policy name "STIG_Compliance" and provide any description you like. Then click "Next"

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/533Ege04oTXKlR_loqIvKBgGqXp2pUdeNPjrTJTmgNJYnzVSZeNw-Gj7Au5HRJ8Wt-EFzjZEGJnZrhH9qgqnyEe7yJJwo6H4LLsRSITUQl9vPxcpWYoo5jksK--v8G2Do_kWJvtB)

-   Select the "Red Hat rhel7 default content" and "DISA STIG for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7". There is no tailoring file. Then click "Next"

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/WSMWISWqV4d5Lm-rOHEZDmsoRaijc642iIhi7l23Tpe5XCJMEk__7xP0o3pj7lDbP0NJssxNI7a0FMbj21r8FPwqjkQ0W58lmyvprQXu3xgoCNiuii6VGwkt1BH_Hb7psI5XBE5c)

-   It is necessary to set a schedule when creating a new compliance policy. You can select "Weekly" and "Monday" for lab purposes. Then click "Next"

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/rvXj6ousHaUVEs4XBXe-wON8U3LqnSFN8xrTYtQLEWQ1_YmbPDy3Ytw3Muogeb5tYFkG4rxr5s2MlGlJgjSh4gIc53Ovx0o_VEWHrU7YRH_OM6XyLKZmJLR9m8dOucga_HcFaf5_)

-   Steps 5, 6, and 7 as part of the New Compliance Policy can use default values. Click "Next" through "Locations", "Organizations", and "Hostgroups"

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Y2DSZltuMov4zXtop_IYzfWZXRRmyk2Ogvnv-Sz22QGaKWm4QD7LcVtjkVP3inDSFIlLUiaRC267gnBrABF0sNJCx-lXN-19Ufu4le-HdUzWz36fxAI4nizD3bi5piEwEoJN3JXF)

-   Now, we will update our OpenSCAP_Configure job template in Ansible Automation Platform and run another PCI compliance scan, plus the STIG compliance scan. 
-   In Ansible Automation Platform, click 'Templates' from the left side pane menu
-   Then select on the OpenSCAP_Configure job template. Make the following changes: (NOTE the change to "Extra Variables")

        Name: OpenSCAP_Configure

        Job Type: Run

        Inventory: RHEL7 Development

        Playbook: configure_openscap.yml

        Project: Automated Management 

        Credentials: Satellite Credential, Workshop Credential (Click the magnifying glass icon to select. Select Satellite_Collection in the CREDENTIAL TYPE    
                     dropdown to add the Satellite Credential)

        Extra Variables:

        HOSTS: all
        Policy_scan: 
          - PCI_Compliance
          - STIG_Compliance

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/iCCURghDHALpdGLVfUAlVZCq7QdA4gUrIX4rqgSi8eFIrkcWRxR78i7vm0QZkzTCs4CnoskfAEoGg4KTzzxQJWu3PlqSZF102RrMNnWe6No-8slovEzCQHYZHghr1SSrNKmoeKE2)

-   Leave the rest of the fields blank or as they are, and click 'Save'. You can then select 'Launch' to deploy the job template.

#### 8\. Navigate back to Satellite to examine the Asset Reporting File (ARF). 

-   Hover over "Hosts" from the menu on the left side of the screen, and then click on "Reports".

-   Notice that we've now easily scaled to six scans, 2 scans of each node for PCI_Compliance and for STIG_Compliance. 

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/BoUp9jxDCNaqpWabW1hdEZJazSA5T79Oh1jt7hzCaLtm374oH8EZfrloculCO3ekg2ncdqKMAzAGqdXo7bwNsmMPaxElddYXZx7vmbS3s-J3bGKqCClh7wPjDq0oVC3zL8Xq1wIc)

-   Each report can be reviewed independent of other node scans and remediations for rule findings can be completed according to the requirements of your own internal policies.

#### 9\. End Lab

-   You have finished the lab.
-   Continue to [Exercise 2: Patch Management / OS](https://github.com/redhat-partner-tech/partner-tech-days-march2021/blob/main/integrated-mgmt-workshop/exercises/2-patching/automated-patch-management.md), OR [Return to the main workshop page](https://github.com/redhat-partner-tech/partner-tech-days-march2021/tree/main/integrated-mgmt-workshop#guide)
